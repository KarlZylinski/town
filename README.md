# town
A town AI simulation where the townspeople wander around and try to fullfill their needs. When they're restless they dance around trees. When they need to party the jump up and down with beer in their hands at the pub. When they are tired they go to their bed in their house. Made at No More Sweden 2015. I wrote this in lua using my own minimalistic shape rendering lib pvx (https://github.com/KarlZylinski/pvx). Features massively non-optimized gamejam made A* path finding.
